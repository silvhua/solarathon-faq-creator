I did a fair amount of work comparing Streamlit and Shiny, and Streamlit does actually do kind of complex stuff with state that can bite you. Basically it feels like you're rerunning everything from top to bottom, but in actuality it's storing everything in hidden state between runs which can cause really gnarly bugs for very simple things. \n\nThe best simple example i found was updating a slider with a button. In a reactive framework this is really straightforward, but in Steamlit you have to kind of fundamentally change how you think about your application to get it to work. This might be a nice one to add to the Solara-Streamlit comparison page.", "reference_id": null, "created_at": "06/30/2023T14:47:08", "channel_id": 1106593686223069309, "channel_name": "general"}, {"id": 1124331778774147092, "author_id": 518050074501185537, "content": "Really nice!\n\nJust a few comments:\n\"In streamlit state is handled for you, in solara you\u2019ve to solve it yourself \u2013 but at least there\u2019s no hidden magic that can become very complex when the app grows.\"\n\nI am not sure what you mean by that.

Solara seems like a very exciting project to me!\nBefore you released solara, I was considering testing panel (unpopular for some reason) or streamlit. Could you tell me some main differences (advantages) of solara over panel?

Concrete classes are lean.\n\nEasily add new types: A new class (DaskHandler, XarrayHandler) inherits the interface. Cross filter automatically supports the new type, no changes needed.\n\nInteroperability: Cross filter works with any class inheriting the interface. External libraries built on the interface also support multiple types.\n\nAvoid if-else logic: The base class dispatches the correct concrete class. Each concrete class focuses on one type.\n\nConfidence from testing: Test the base interface, know concrete classes will work.

In similar previous implementations, I've used decorators like that. I've found that `asyncio.run` is cleaner, and perhaps more maintainable across environments (developing in Jupyter, deploying in FastAPI, etc). However, a common exception is that `asyncio.run` cannot be called from a running event loop. I think this exception may be somewhat inconsistent in Jupyter environments. You do get the exception if you call it from a Solara component. The common fix for this exception is simply `nest_asyncio.apply`.\n\nIn FastAPI, you can declare your endpoints as async and so it doesn't matter, but as far as I know, you cannot use `async def` to define components. There may be another approach I'm not aware of,  like maybe mounting it in a FastAPI app would solve the issue. But `nest_asyncio.apply` allows you to call asyncio.run from within a Solara component. I haven't noticed any issues, and I haven't heard any definitive reason why nest_asyncio should be avoided. I think it could make things difficult to debug or something, if I recall correctly.\n\nSoo... long way of saying that unless I can define components with async def, I'll probably just continue to use nest_asyncio. I think it comes with Solara and/or Jupyter anyway.\n\nOn a related note, I'm dropping a couple screenshots of a fun little demo app that I plan on publishing very soon! It uses asyncio.run to gather the data layers \ud83d\ude42\n\nedit: Oh wait did you mean decorate the components?

Understanding which style applies / when to use the !important property etc. is still a learning curve especially for non-frontend devs / data scientists etc. That's where MUI shines: It doesn't get simpler than defining a JSON color palette - abstract all the CSS away and let the components handle it. \n\nOn my background: I'm not experienced in frontend web dev,  especially I have no experience in vue, vuetify or ipyvuetify - all new frameworks / libraries to me. Whereas the docs on the solary reactive side are very well documented, when it comes to styling I need to consult the vuetify and ipyvuetify docs and still not everything is clear to me.\n\nWhat I'm currently lacking is a \"best practice\"  for styling in solara:\n- Should I define an assets/custom.css? If yes: Ad hoc I have no idea which classes to define in there / which classes are applied to the widget by default \n-  Vs. assets/theme.js: Why do I need both theme.js and custom.css? Ideally I'd define a preset color theme (background color, primary, secodary, font, etc.) for dark / light in theme.js and they're automatically applied to all widgets\n- You're saying don't use \"class_\": It might be worth adding a theming section to the docs where such things are documented. I guess the trailing underscore hints at \"not public api\" \n\nLast but not least, I'm pretty happy with the rest of the Solara API and most of its docs, really nice and clean!

Hoping to find a bit better experience with this project. Looks very promising! When researching the Todo App example just wanted to ask the best way to incorporate a \"sub todo list\" into each todo list item? Declare a subtodos list with would be a list of TodoItems and then just add a id to associated back to the main TodoItem that would be the parent item? Or should I create a separate solara component that only keeps state for the SubTodos. A bit confused on how the whole Ref from the lab functionality works.
