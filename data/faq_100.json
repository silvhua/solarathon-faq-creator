"[\n    {\n        \"question\": \"Why am I getting an error 'Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'extend')'?\",\n        \"answer\": \"This error is usually caused by an issue with the Vue library. It could be that the jupyter-vue library is not loaded or is loaded after jupyter-vuetify. To troubleshoot this issue, you can take a screenshot of the network tab when filtering on 'vue' and check if the jupyter-vue library is being loaded correctly. If not, you may need to reinstall or update the library. Another possible solution is to try running the app on a different environment or cluster. Additionally, make sure you are not using ipyvue version 3, as it is still in alpha and may cause compatibility issues.\",\n        \"topic\": \"Error: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'extend')\",\n        \"integrations\": [\"Vue\", \"jupyter-vue\", \"jupyter-vuetify\", \"ipyvue\"],\n        \"category\": \"Error\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"question\": \"How can I fix the issue with 'Error displaying widget: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'extend')'?\",\n        \"answer\": \"If you are experiencing this error, you can try disabling the cache and reloading the page.
