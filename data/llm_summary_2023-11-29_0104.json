[{"question": "How does Solara handle state management?", "answer": "Solara handles state management using reactive variables that are thread-safe and can be updated to trigger UI re-renders. Components can be designed to be pure and re-execute when state changes, with Solara/Reacton sorting out the differences and updating only what has changed. Reactive variables can be created using `solara.use_reactive` for local component state or `solara.reactive` for global application state."}, {"question": "Can Solara be used with JupyterLite?", "answer": "Yes, Solara can be used with JupyterLite. However, there may be some limitations due to JupyterLite's environment, such as restrictions on installing certain dependencies or issues with specific browser behaviors."}, {"question": "Is it possible to deploy Solara on AWS Lambda?", "answer": "Deploying Solara on AWS Lambda may be challenging due to potential size constraints and the serverless environment's limitations, such as lack of support for websockets. Alternative deployment options like Docker containers with ECS or EC2 instances may be more suitable."}, {"question": "How can I make Plotly animations work in Solara?", "answer": "Plotly animations should work in Solara by using the appropriate Plotly functions and components. If animations are not working as expected, it may be due to limitations in the Plotly widget or the need for additional configuration."}, {"question": "Can I define async components in Solara?", "answer": "Currently, Solara does not support defining async components directly. However, you can use `asyncio.create_task` or `solara.use_thread` to run asynchronous operations and update reactive state within components."}, {"question": "Does Solara support Vuetify blueprints?", "answer": "Solara currently uses Vue 2 and Vuetify 2, which may not support Vuetify blueprints. However, Solara plans to eventually switch to Vue 3 and Vuetify 3, which could include support for blueprints."}, {"question": "How can I pass arguments to functions through Solara buttons?", "answer": "In Solara, you can pass arguments to functions through buttons by using lambda functions or by defining the argument as a local variable within the component and passing it directly to the `on_click` event handler."}, {"question": "Can I use ipywidgets widgets like `ipywidgets.Play` in a Solara environment?", "answer": "Yes, you can use ipywidgets widgets like `ipywidgets.Play` in a Solara environment. If you encounter issues with the widget not updating as expected, it may be due to the need for additional configuration or the use of reactive variables."}, {"question": "How can I center-align a page in Solara?", "answer": "To center-align a page in Solara, you can use the `align` attribute of the `solara.Column` component and set it to `center`. This will align the content of the column to the center."}, {"question": "Is it possible to have a background image on a Solara page?", "answer": "While Solara does not have a built-in feature for background images, you can use CSS to set a background image for a page or component. You can add the CSS using the `solara.Style` component."}]
