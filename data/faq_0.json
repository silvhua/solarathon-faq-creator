"[\n    {\n        \"question\": \"How to clear out the file upload state in Solara?\",\n        \"answer\": \"You can clear the file upload state by using a button which processes the uploaded files and then clears the upload.

You should instead, create a new dataframe and assign to .value that new dataframe.
