I'm attempting to use \"FileDrop\", but I can't seem to get the data from the output. The fileInfo['data'] object is a binary string, and not super useful for creating a pandas csv. Is there a simple way to read the drag and dropped csv into a pandas dataframe to be used in the rest of the app?

This seems like it's caused by chained value updates, where one value causes a change in another value. This creates problems for some of my UI components that only display if a value is set, so the UI component looks like it flickers. I've resorted to setting an intermediate value, but that's less than ideal as well.\n\nAny suggestions on preventing rendering of the page until there is some kind of reactive value stability?", "reference_id": null, "created_at": "09/12/2023T03:00:00", "channel_id": 1106593686223069309, "channel_name": "general"}, {"id": 1150942415583187104, "author_id": 593610951509540864, "content": "Maybe call them global and local reactive or something.", "reference_id": null, "created_at": "09/11/2023T23:54:15", "channel_id": 1106593686223069309, "channel_name": "general"}, {"id": 1150942304757100705, "author_id": 593610951509540864, "content": "To that end, do you think a renaming of those might make them more intuitive?", "reference_id": null, "created_at": "09/11/2023T23:53:48", "channel_id": 1106593686223069309, "channel_name": "general"}, {"id": 1150591591812186112, "author_id": 593610951509540864, "content": "Ugh, I figured it out.
