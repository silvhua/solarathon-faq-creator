Here is an example:\n\n```\ndef btn_click(*args):\nset_key(str(uuid.uuid4()))\non_new_file(file_items)\n\nwith solara.Row() as main:\nfile_input = FileInput(\naccept='.csv', multiple=True, lazy=True, on_file=on_file, dense=True, outlined=True\n).key(key)\nbtn = solara.Button(label='Add', on_click=btn_click)\n```\n                  ", "content_type": "text", "integrations": ["solara", "uuid"], "topic": "File Upload", "category": "File Handling"}, {"id": 1, "content": "\n                    Question : \n                    How to trigger a page reload in Solara? ;\n                    Answer :\n                    You can trigger a page re-render by changing some other reactive variable if needed.

You should instead, create a new dataframe and assign to .value that new dataframe. Here is an example:\n\n```\ndef add_row():\n# Create a new DataFrame with the added row\nnew_data = files_df.value.append({'Name': 'football.avi'}, ignore_index=True)\n# Update the reactive variable\nfiles_df.value = new_data\n```\n                  ", "content_type": "text", "integrations": ["solara", "pandas"], "topic": "DataFrame Update", "category": "Data Handling"}, {"id": 4, "content": "\n                    Question : \n                    How to create a control-flow using OnClick in Solara? ;\n                    Answer :\n                    You can create a control-flow using OnClick by setting 'is_pressed' to true, which then kicks off a memoized.use_thread if True.
